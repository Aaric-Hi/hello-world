# hello-world
My first repository 
I created a GitHub account as a suggestion for the certificate I'm doing with Google: Data Analytics. I have always had an interest in data, especially with sports, since I was a kid. I recently made the decision to start a career change and dive in to learning more about data analytics! I'm excited to learn and grow.
